    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm learning front-end development with ALX and this is my very first webpage. I'm excited to build amazing things on the web.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about technology, creativity, and problem-solving. My goal is to create useful, beautiful, and accessible digital experiences.</p>

    <h3>My Interests</h3>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy designing, reading about tech innovations, and mentoring new learners in tech.</p>

    <p>This project is part of my ALX Front-End Development journey — the foundation of many exciting things ahead!</p>
